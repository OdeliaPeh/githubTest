    "text": "1 The Issue: Singapore’s Ageing Population\nAgeing Population:\nSingapore’s population of 65 and older has been by 11.7% over the past decade. This trend is expected to persist with longer lifespans and a large proportion of the population falling within the age range.\nGovernmental Action:\nTo address this, the government is building more polyclinics and eldercare centres, diversifying their capabilities, and removing physical barriers to entry. It is also pushing for active ageing, encouraging elderly individuals to engage in social and physical activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle and mindset.\nOur Aim:\nThrough our project, we hope to provide insights about the geographical distribution, accessibility and segmentation of eldercare centres in Singapore. With better understanding of the connection between Singapore’s elderly and the existing relevant facilities, the authorities could potentially be better informed when planning and making decisions for the urban landscape, rolling out plans that better support the elderly in Singapore.\n\n\n2 Our Motivation\nSingapore has experienced a demographic shift, with the proportion of the citizens aged 65 and older increasing by 11.7% from 10 years ago. (Source) Such a shift comes with a higher prevalence of chronic illness and disabilities. To address this, the Singaporean government has committed to building more polyclinics (Source) and eldercare centres (Source). Furthermore, they intend to diversify eldercare centres’ capabilities to also encompass basic health check-ups (Source) and they are working towards removing physical barriers to entry in current polyclinics. These measures are to ensure that healthcare remains physically accessible to any elderly person who needs it. This is especially important since geographical accessibility has been identified as one of the biggest contributing factors to polyclinic visitations (Source).\nFurthermore, the government has been pushing for active ageing, where the elderly persons still engage in social and physical activity to maintain their health and well-being (Source). To this end, the Singaporean government has been trying to increase the number of active ageing centres (Source) to make it more accessible to seniors.\nAs such, our project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the geographical distribution of eldercare centres throughout Singapore. Currently, there have been studies conducted to understand the geographical accessibility of the polyclinics, as well as identify any potentially underserved regions. One study conducted in 2012 suggested that Sembawang and Jurong West were two underserved regions. (Source). With the rising elderly population, we must ensure that there are sufficient facilities to meet the growing demand in each region. A more recent study conducted in 2018 suggests that eldercare specifically is sparse in the Central Region. (Source) \nOur exact objectives will be discussed in the following section.\nCurrently, there are studies to understand the geographical accessibility of the polyclinics, and identify any potentially underserved regions. Nonetheless, applications that help users derive a quick and comprehensive analysis of these facilities are not widely available.\nWith the rising elderly population, we must ensure that there are sufficient facilities to meet the growing demand in each region. A more recent study conducted in 2018 suggests that eldercare is sparse in the Central Region. We hope our app would be helpful towards planning to better support our beloved older generations.\n\n\n3 Approaches\nFor this project, we would like to achieve the following objectives:\nKernel Density Estimation To estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable over a geographic area by placing a kernel function on each data point and summing up their contributions. This helps us visualizing spatial patterns of data points.\nApproach 2: Accessibility Analysis To assess the ease of reaching destinations from a given location, often using measures like travel time or distance, aiding urban planning and decision-making by identifying areas with varying levels of accessibility.\nApproach 3: Geographical Segmentation To divide our elderly population based on physical location, such as region, planning area, or subzone, allowing the government to tailor strategies to specific geographic areas.\n#4 The Data\nThe following is our data, inclusive of the site it was sourced from and its content.\n\n\n\nData set (link)\nContent\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Residents by Planning Area, Age Group and Sex, Jun 2023 (Gender)\n\nSource: Department of Statistics, Singapore\nContent: Geospatial and attribute data containing the number of Singapore residents in each planning area, by age groups of 5 years, in 2018\nType: Polygon Data\n\n\n\nEldercare Services\n\nSource: Ministry of Health, Singapore\nContent: Geospatial and attribute data containing the records of eldercare services in Singapore as of February 29, 2024\nType: Point Data\n\n\n\nPois Data Set from Geofabrik\n\nSource: OpenStreetMap of Geofabrik server\nContent: Facilties in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei (e.g. parks, community centres, hospital)\nType: Polygon Data\n\n\n\nCommunity in Bloom (CIB)\n\nSource: National Parks Board, Singapore\nContent: Community gardens in Singapore\nType: Point Data\n\n\n\nResidents By Age Group & Type Of Dwelling\n\nSource: Singstat\nContent: age groups according to type of housing they are in\nType: Aspatial data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain features\nFeature 1: Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nUsage:\n\n\nVisualize and examine the distribution of attribute data\nVisualize the trend of attribute data \nDiscover potential anomalies, outliers, or trends\n\n\nSelections that users can make\n\nAge range\nTypes of facilities\nPlanning area/subzone\n\n\nFeature 2: Kernel Density Estimation\n\nUsage: Visualize and examine the distribution of attribute data (facilities and amenities) across Singapore\nSelections that users can make:\n\nType of facilities/amenities: \n\nExamples: Hospitals, Senior Activity Centres, Parks\n\nPlanning subzone\n\nExamples: Bedok, Tampines\n\nKDE parameter (Bandwith)\n\nExamples: automatic, fixed, adaptive\n\nKDE Parameter (Kernel Method)\n\nExamples: gaussian,  epanechnikov, quartic, disc,\n\n\n\nFeature 3: Analytical Regionalisation and Geographical Segmentation\n\nUsage: Visualize the geographical / delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data\n\n\n\nEmploy concepts of geographic segmentation\nApply conventional cluster analysis techniques\nDelineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data\nParameters:\n\nStandardization (min-max, z-score) → hierarchy cluster\nApproaches (SKATER, ClusGeo) → spatially constrained cluster extra split?\n\nClusGeo: Number of clusters (k value)\nSKATER: \n\n\n\n\nFeature 4: Integrated analysis/summary (check with prof first)\n\nCombining KDE and analytical regionalisation\nVisualize and examine whether clusters of facilities coincide with regions containing a high density of elderly\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\nData Preparation\n\n\nSourcing geospatial and attribute data from reliable data platforms\nImporting data into R\nData wrangling using R packages: \n\nTo clean and validate data\nTo extract relevant study areas and attributes\n\nR packages used: (to add more if necessary; maybe don’t include in proposal first)\n\ntidyr\ntmap\nsf\nsfdep \ntidyverse\n\n\n2.

This helps us visualise spatial patterns of data points.\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nRandomness\n\nIn our spatial points pattern analysis, we assumed that the distribution of the various amenities is random and is not significantly constrained by networks such as roads and rivers. Given that the networks do not constrain persons from accessing the other amenities, we found that this assumption is justifiable.\n\nConstant Density\n\nIn our analysis, we also assumed that there are no significant disparities in the density of amenities in a given space. This was not necessarily true as there were regions with 0 amenities and others with a significant number. This assumption was made due to two reasons: constraints with regard to the Shiny app’s deployment and the unofficial nature of our data."

However, we do not have access to data of the actual residences of each elderly to determine an accurate spread. Hence, we applied the following steps:\n\nDetermine the number of elderly in each subzone using the population data from the Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2023 data set\nFind the number of HDB in each hexagon and subzone, based on HDB Buildings data set\nFind the number of elderly in each hexagon using the number of HDB in each hexagon relative to the number of HDB in the entire subzone, that is:\n\nNumber of elderly in each hexagon = Number of HDB in the hexagon/Number of HDB in the subzone * Number of elderly in the subzone\n\n\n\nCapacity of Services - As we were unable to derive the exact capacity of each facility due to limited data on the internet, we assumed that the spread of supply of services (capacity at any point in time) based on the following features:\n\nEldercare Centres: Based on an article\nOther facilities: Estimation based on the average size of these facilities \n\n\nWith access to more comprehensive data, we would be able to give a more accurate picture of the accessibility to the facilities in Singapore ."

This would allow users to easily identify areas that they are interested in by hovering over the area. However, due to the complexity of such plots, it significantly lengthens the loading time of the app. Hence, taking into consideration costs and benefits, we decided that using a static plot that is more appropriate at this juncture. With more resources in the future, it would be good if we could implement the interactive plot.\nAvailability of Data: As mentioned earlier, we made a few assumptions about the demand and capacity of the facilities. Thought they are arguably good estimates, they might not provide the most accurate representation of reality. Hence, we can improve in the future if we are given access to such comprehensive data."
