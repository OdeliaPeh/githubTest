    "text": "Singapore is experiencing an ageing population, with an increasing proportion of the citizens aged 65 and older by 11.7% compared to 10 years ago (Source). In addition, the life expectancy of Singaporeans has been steadily rising over the past five decades (Source). This has prompted the government to commit to building more eldercare facilities nationwide. Alongside this has come a push for Active Ageing to encourage the elderly to “stay active, healthy and socially engaged”. (Source) To achieve this goal, the government has also been trying to increase the number of active ageing centres (Source) and possible locations for activities to make it more accessible to seniors.\nOur project would like to understand what the current distribution of eldercare facilities and amenities is across Singapore and selected planning areas within Singapore. We want to investigate whether there are enough facilities and amenities to ensure that the elderly not just age healthily, but age well. We also want to understand whether there are any clusters of the elderly population, and whether the distribution of facilities and amenities creates an overlapping cluster.\nOur objectives are first to obtain and visualise the hot and cold spots of the elderly population across Singapore as well as all eldercare facilities and amenities. We want to investigate whether eldercare facilities are spread evenly or overlap in clusters with clusters of elderly population."

    "text": "Project Motivation\nSingapore has experienced a demographic shift, with the proportion of the citizens aged 65 and older increasing by 11.7% from 10 years ago. (Source) Such a shift comes with a higher prevalence of chronic illness and disabilities. To address this, the Singaporean government has committed to building more polyclinics (Source) and eldercare centres (Source). Furthermore, they intend to diversify eldercare centres’ capabilities to also encompass basic health check-ups (Source) and they are working towards removing physical barriers to entry in current polyclinics. These measures are to ensure that healthcare remains physically accessible to any elderly person who needs it. This is especially important since geographical accessibility has been identified as one of the biggest contributing factors to polyclinic visitations (Source).\nFurthermore, the government has been pushing for active ageing, where the elderly persons still engage in social and physical activity to maintain their health and well-being (Source). To this end, the Singaporean government has been trying to increase the number of active ageing centres (Source) to make it more accessible to seniors.\nAs such, our project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the geographical distribution of eldercare centres throughout Singapore. Currently, there have been studies conducted to understand the geographical accessibility of the polyclinics, as well as identify any potentially underserved regions. One study conducted in 2012 suggested that Sembawang and Jurong West were two underserved regions. (Source). With the rising elderly population, we must ensure that there are sufficient facilities to meet the growing demand in each region. A more recent study conducted in 2018 suggests that eldercare specifically is sparse in the Central Region.
