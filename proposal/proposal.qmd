# Project Theme

Analytical Regionalisation and Geographical Segmentation (tentative)

# Project Motivation

Singapore has experienced a demographic shift, with the proportion of the citizens aged 65 and older increasing by 11.7% from 10 years ago. ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/30/as-singapores-aging-population-grows-businesses-court-older-spenders.html)) Such a shift comes with a higher prevalence of chronic illness and disabilities. To address this, the Singaporean government has committed to building more polyclinics ([Source](https://www.pap.org.sg/news/ensuring-quality-healthcare-remains-accessible-and-affordable/)) and eldercare centres ([Source](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-aims-double-number-eldercare-centres-2025-and-expand-their-services-1924086)). Furthermore, they intend to diversify eldercare centres’ capabilities to also encompass basic health check-ups ([Source](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-aims-double-number-eldercare-centres-2025-and-expand-their-services-1924086)) and they are working towards removing physical barriers to entry in current polyclinics. These measures are to ensure that healthcare remains physically accessible to any elderly person who needs it. This is especially important since geographical accessibility has been identified as one of the biggest contributing factors to polyclinic visitations ([Source](http://www.smj.org.sg/sites/default/files/5302/5302a7.pdf)).

Furthermore, the government has been pushing for active ageing, where the elderly persons still engage in social and physical activity to maintain their health and well-being ([Source](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/embracing-the-golden-age)). To this end, the Singaporean government has been trying to increase the number of active ageing centres ([Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2023-active-ageing-centres-to-be-expanded-to-help-seniors-stay-active-and-healthy)) to make it more accessible to seniors.

As such, our project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the geographical distribution of eldercare centres throughout Singapore. Currently, there have been studies conducted to understand the geographical accessibility of the polyclinics, as well as identify any potentially underserved regions. One study conducted in 2012 suggested that Sembawang and Jurong West were two underserved regions. ([Source](https://search.library.smu.edu.sg/permalink/65SMU_INST/1ba19kd/cdi_openaire_primary_doi_dedup_0a81367451c0764f9c94de2416016ce7)). With the rising elderly population, we must ensure that there are sufficient facilities to meet the growing demand in each region. A more recent study conducted in 2018 suggests that eldercare specifically is sparse in the Central Region. ([Source](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/223231)) 

Our exact objectives will be discussed in the following section.

# Objectives

For this project, we would like to achieve the following objectives:

-   To visualise hot and cold spots for our selected age demographics (elderly aged 65-100)

-   To plot the locations of various eldercare amenities and facilities across Singapore

    -   To visualise whether these amenities are distributed evenly across Singapore

# Data

The following is our data, inclusive of the site it was sourced from and its content.

# Main features

Feature 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

1.  Usage:

-   Visualize and examine the distribution of attribute data

-   Visualize the trend of attribute data 

-   Discover potential anomalies, outliers, or trends

2.  Selections that users can make

    1.  Age range

    2.  Types of facilities

    3.  Planning area/subzone

Feature 2: Kernel Density Estimation

-   Usage: Visualize and examine the distribution of attribute data (facilities and amenities) across Singapore

-   Selections that users can make:

    -   Type of facilities/amenities: 

        -   Examples: Hospitals, Senior Activity Centres, Parks

    -   Planning subzone

        -   Examples: Bedok, Tampines

    -   KDE parameter (Bandwith)

        -   Examples: automatic, fixed, adaptive

    -   KDE Parameter (Kernel Method)

        -   Examples: gaussian,  epanechnikov, quartic, disc,

Feature 3: Analytical Regionalisation and Geographical Segmentation

-   Usage: Visualize the geographical / delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Employ concepts of geographic segmentation

-   Apply conventional cluster analysis techniques

-   Delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data

-   Parameters:

    -   Standardization (min-max, z-score) → hierarchy cluster

    -   Approaches (SKATER, ClusGeo) → spatially constrained cluster extra split?

        -   ClusGeo: Number of clusters (k value)

        -   SKATER: 

    -   

Feature 4: Integrated analysis/summary (check with prof first)

-   Combining KDE and analytical regionalisation

-   Visualize and examine whether clusters of facilities coincide with regions containing a high density of elderly

# Methodology

1.  Data Preparation

-   Sourcing geospatial and attribute data from reliable data platforms

-   Importing data into R

-   Data wrangling using R packages: 

    -   To clean and validate data

    -   To extract relevant study areas and attributes

-   R packages used: (to add more if necessary; maybe don’t include in proposal first)

    -   tidyr

    -   tmap

    -   sf

    -   sfdep 

    -   tidyverse
